# Insufficient Error Handling in Dart API Call

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart code: insufficient error handling during an API call. The `bug.dart` file shows code that's prone to crashes due to neglecting various possible errors. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a more robust solution.

**Problem:** The original code only handles a non-200 HTTP status code. It doesn't consider other potential issues like network connectivity issues, JSON decoding errors (e.g., if the server returns invalid JSON), or the absence of expected keys in the JSON response.

**Solution:** The improved code adds more comprehensive error handling to address these potential problems.  Specific checks and logging make it more reliable and easier to debug.
